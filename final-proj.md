# Final Project

## General

Find a partner to form a group and define a final project and carry out a month-long
research and implementation. Group size can vary from **2–3** students.  
If you feel strongly that you want to work alone, you must submit a special request
and receive the professor’s approval.

The final project will be delivered in the form of:
- A **presentation**
- A **paper**

### Types of Final Projects

You may choose from (but are not limited to) the following types:
- Solve a well-defined **computer vision (CV), NLP, or audio ML task** using a dataset and compare several methods
- Build an **AI product feature** using one or more modalities
- Perform **exploratory analysis** of text, audio, or image data (see NLP4DH below)
- **Replicate a research paper**
- **Propose a new method** for a task

## Project Requirements

Regardless of project type:

- You must explore **at least one novel method** not covered in class  
- This may include:
  - A new task not discussed in detail in class
  - New methods applied to a known task
- Each co-author must contribute **at least one novel method**
- The paper must:
  - Compare several approaches
  - Include a **simple baseline**
  - Report experimental results
- The project scope must be **small enough to complete in ~1 month**

### Time Estimation

Include an estimated timeline covering:
- Literature review
- Data collection and curation
- Coding and experimentation
- Writing

This ensures the project is feasible within the time frame.

### Evaluation Planning

- Define how methods will be evaluated
- If annotated ground-truth data is required:
  - Explain how it will be obtained

## Ideas and Examples

You are encouraged to pursue topics of personal interest.  
If you have an idea:
- Discuss it with peers and the professor
- Search for relevant datasets and resources
- Define a **limited-scope, practical project** that can be completed in **4–5 weeks**

## Multimodal Projects

⚠️ Training multimodal models (a project that tackles more than one modality at once) can be challenging and are not recommended unless the scope is limited.

Examples:
- Audio captioning
- Image captioning
- Image question answering
- Audio question answering
- Audio-visual tasks (such as segmentation and separation)

Resources:
- Language–image: CLIP paper and related datasets
- Language–audio: CLAP model, WAVCaps, etc.

## Project Proposal Components

Your proposal may include:
- Dataset
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Research question
- Problem description
- Scope
- Literature review (1–2 papers per person)
- Methodology  
  (Compare novel methods not covered in class to a baseline)
- Evaluation
- Error analysis
- Timeline estimation

> The proposal does **not** need to include all components initially.  
> Focus on motivation, problem definition, dataset, scope, and research plan.
