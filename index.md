<details>
<summary> Course description </summary>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) employs a variety of modalities, including image, audio, and text to interact with the world around us. This course is designed to introduce students to the machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to data in multiple modalities. Students will gain a broad understanding of how these techniques are being applied to domain-specific problems ranging from computer vision to natural language processing to audio and music understanding. Students will gain hands-on experience implementing AI algorithms and building AI systems using popular ML tools and frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow/Keras. The skills learned in this course will be valuable for career paths in various industries with a diverse product portfolio. Prerequisites: proficient in python coding; familiarity with probability, linear algebra and calculus (Spring)

<summary> Homework, presentations and final projects</summary>

To adapt to the rapidly evolving field of AI, this course is designed to simulate the real-world environment of a R&D AI practitioner wherever possible. Instead of being a static, lecture and exam based course, the students will have plenty of opportunities to actively conduct independent research, collaborate with teammates, present their projects, and keep up with the SOTA research on NLP and AI. Each student will be assigned to a team in the class. Each team is reponsible for delivering multiple code reviews and presenting on research papers throughout the term. Students will then have the opportunity to form their own teams to conduct a month-long research project on a topic of interest that will result in a final paper with the potential to submit to a conference for publication.
